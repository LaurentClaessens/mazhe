This document is a compilation of many stuff I wrote during my mathematical live. There are mainly three parts :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exercises for undergrad (in French).
    \item Theory for undergrad (in French, mainly devoted to l'agr√©gation)
    \item Theory I studied during my thesis (in English)
    \item Some research material (the BTZ part, in English)
\end{itemize}
Some parts of this text were written in 2003 wile others were written yesterday; don't expect a high quality everywhere. This document thus takes the point of view of the learner with some consequences. As far as I can judge my own work:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        There are \emph{much} more details in the proofs in this text that what you can find in other textbooks.
    \item
        This is not a text in which you can get a deep understanding of what you are reading.
    \item
        There are (many) holes in the text.
\end{enumerate}

There are still open questions in the sense that there are points I didn't understand when I wrote. I think that these points are clearly indicated with footnotes or special environment ``Problem and misunderstanding''. Let me know if you know some answers.

By the way, let me know any comment or suggestions.
