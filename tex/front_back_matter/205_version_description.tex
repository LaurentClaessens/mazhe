This file contains everything I know in math and some more by other contributors.

Subdivided in two main parts

	\item[Le Frido] in French contains the mathematics for the first few years in mathematics: from the construction of the rationals to the Markov chains through Lebesgue measure, representation theory and fields extensions.
	\item[Giulietta] in English contains whatever mathematics at higher level.
\end{description}
