This file contains everything I know in math and some more by other contributors.

Subdivided in two main parts

    \item[Le Frido] in French contains the mathematics for the first few years in mathematics: from the construction of the rationals to the Markov chains trough Lebesgue measure, representation theory and fields extensions.
    \item[Giulietta] in English contains whatever mathematics at higher level.
\end{description}
