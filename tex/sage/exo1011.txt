The function :
(x, y) |--> x^3 - 3*x*y^2
Derivative x and y :
(x, y) |--> 3*x^2 - 3*y^2
(x, y) |--> -6*x*y
Hessian matrix :
[ 6*x -6*y]
[-6*y -6*x]
Critical points :
(0, 0)
At (0,0), the Hessian is
	(0, 0)
	(0, 0)
	Primary principal minors are [0, 0]
	Hessian positive semid√©finite
	I don't conclude
	Hessian negative semidefinite
	I don't conclude
