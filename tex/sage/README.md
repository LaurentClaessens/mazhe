# Le r√©pertoire `sage`

This directory contains the `.sage` files included in the document. Be careful because some are included more than once, in particular the ones in `tex/frido/44_sage.tex` are also included in some exercises.

This directory also contains `txt` files that are the output of some of these `.sage` scripts.
