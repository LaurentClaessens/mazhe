\begin{propositionDef}[Integral of a differential form on a manifold]       \label{DEFooOMQLooGiJWZS}

	Let \( M\) be a manifold. Let \(  \{ (\varphi_i,U_i) \}_{i\in I}\) and \( \{ (\psi_j,V_j) \}_{j\in J}\) be two atlas of \( M\). We consider \( \{ f_i \}_{i\in I}\) and \( \{ g_j \}_{j\in J}\) be parition of the unity subordinated to the respective two atlases.

	Then we have
	\begin{equation}
		\sum_{i\in I}\int_{\varphi_i(U_i)}f_i\omega=\sum_{j\in J}\int_{\psi_j(V_j)}g_j\omega.
	\end{equation}
	This number is the \defe{integral of \( \omega\) on \( M\)}{integral of a differential form} and is denoted by
	\begin{equation}
		\int_M\omega
	\end{equation}
\end{propositionDef}
