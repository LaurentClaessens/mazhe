\section{Lie algebra of a Lie group}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

\begin{propositionDef}      \label{DEFooKDCPooZOJsMD}
    If \( G\) is a Lie group, its tangent space on at the identity is a Lie algebra. 
    
    This is the \defe{Lie algebra}{Lie algebra of a Lie group} is is tangent space at identity. From a notational point of view, this is written
    \begin{equation}
        \lG=T_eG.
    \end{equation}
\end{propositionDef}

\begin{proof}
    We know from proposition \ref{PROPooOHLQooCNetuD} that \( T_eG\) is a vector space. We have to define a Lie bracket on it. For that we use the left-invariant vector field. Let \( X\in T_eG\) and \( g\in M\) we define
    \begin{equation}
        X^L_g=dL_gX
    \end{equation}
    where \( L_g\colon G\to G\) is the left translation: \( L_g(h)=gh\). If \( X,Y\in T_eG\) we define
    \begin{equation}
        [X,Y]=[X^L,Y^L]_e
    \end{equation}
    where the bracket on the right hand side is the commutator of vector field defined in \ref{DEFooHOTOooRaPwyo}. It defines a Lie algebra structure by the proposition \ref{PROPooSWQSooSEfTuX}.
\end{proof}

In order to make the notations clear, let us write the formula explicitly. If \( X,Y\in T_eG\) are given by \( X=\alpha'(0)\) and \( Y=\beta'(0)\) we have
\begin{subequations}        \label{SUBEQSooHKWMooQbeStl}
    \begin{align}
        (XY)f&=X(Y(f))\\
        &=\Dsdd{ (Yf)\big( \alpha(t) \big) }{t}{0}\\
        &=\Dsdd{ Y_{\alpha(t)}(f) }{t}{0}\\
        &=\Dsdd{ Y^L_{\alpha(t)}(f) }{t}{0}\\
        &=\DDsdd{ f\big( \alpha(t)\beta(u) \big) }{t}{0}{s}{0}.
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

Now a great theorem without proof:
\begin{theorem} \label{tho:loc_isom}
Two Lie groups are locally isomorphic if and only if their Lie algebras are isomorphic.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}		\label{ThoSubGpSubAlg}		\label{tho:gp_alg}
If $G$ is a Lie group, then
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{ThoSubGpSubAlgi} if $\lH$ is the Lie algebra of a Lie subgroup $H$ of $G$, then it is a subalgebra of $\lG$,
\item Any subalgebra of $\lG$ is the Lie algebra of one and only one connected Lie subgroup of $G$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{probleme}
À mon avis, il faut dire ``connexe et simplement connexe'', et non juste ``connexe''.
\end{probleme}

\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

\subdem{First item}
Let $\dpt{i}{H}{G}$ be the identity map; it is a homomorphism from $H$ to $G$, thus $di_e$ is a homomorphism from $\lH$ to $\lG$. Conclusion: $\lH$ is a subalgebra of $\lG$.

\subdem{Characterization for $\lH$}
Before to go on with the second point, we derive an important characterization of $\lH$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:path_alg}
\lH=\{X\in\lG:\text{the map } t\to\exp tX\text{ is a path in $H$}\}.
\end{equation}
For that, consider $\dpt{\exp_H}{\lH}{H}$ and $\dpt{\exp_G}{\lG}{G}$; from unicity of the exponential, for any $X\in\lH$, $\exp_HX=\exp_GX$, so that one can simply write ``$\exp$''\ instead of ``$\exp_h$''\ or ``$\exp_G$''.

Now, if $X\in\lH$, the map $t\to\exp tX$ is a curve in $H$. But it is not immediately clear that such a curve in $H$ is automatically build from a vector in $\lH$ rather than in $\lG$.  More precisely, consider a $X\in\lG$ such that $t\to\exp tX$ is a path (continuous curve) in H. By lemma~\ref{lem:var_cont_diff}, the map $t\to\exp tX$ is differentiable and thus by derivation, $X\in\lH$.
The characterisation \eqref{eq:path_alg} is proved.

Thus $\lH$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\lG$.

\subdem{Second item}
For the second part, we consider $\lH$ any subalgebra of $\lG$ and $H$, the smallest subgroup of $G$ which contains $\exp\lH$. We also consider a basis $\{X_1,\ldots,X_n\}$ of $\lG$ such that $\{X_{r+1},\ldots,X_n\}$ is a basis of $\lH$.

By corollary~\ref{cor:/24}, the set of linear combinations of elements of the form $X(M)$ with $M=(0,\ldots,0,m_{r+1},\ldots,m_r)$ form a subalgebra of $U(\lG)$. If $X=x_1X_1+\cdots+x_nX_n$, we define $|X|=(x_1^2+\cdots+x_n^2)^{1/2}$ ($x_i\in\eR$).

Let us consider a $\delta>0$ such that $\exp$ is a diffeomorphism (normal neighbourhood) from $B_{\delta}=\{X\in\lG:|X|<\delta\}$ to a neighbourhood $N_e$ of $e\in G$ and such that $\forall x,y,xy\in N_e$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:coord_xy}
   (xy)_k=\sum_{M,N}C^{[k]}_{MN}x^My^N
\end{equation}
holds\footnote{The validity of this second condition is assured during the proof of theorem~\ref{tho:loc_isom} which is not given here.}. We note $V=\exp(\lH\cap B_{\delta})\subset N_e$. The map
\[
   \exp(x_{r+1}X_{r+1}+\cdots+x_nX_n)\to(x_{r+1},\ldots,x_n)
\]
is a coordinate system on $V$ for which $V$ is a connected manifold. But $\lH\cap B_{\delta}$ is a submanifold of $B_{\delta}$, then $V$ is a submanifold of $N_e$ and consequently of~$G$.

Let $x$, $y\in V$ such that $xy\in N_e$ (this exist: $x=y=e$); the canonical coordinates of $xy$ are given by \eqref{eq:coord_xy}. Since $x_k=y_k=0$ for $1\leq k\leq r$, $(xy)_k=0$ for the same $k$ because for $(xy)_k$ to be non zero, one need $m_1=\ldots=m_r=n_1=\ldots=n_r=0$ -- otherwise, $x^M$ or $y^N$ is zero. Now we looks at $C^{[k]}_{MN}$ for such a $k$ (say $k=1$ to fix ideas): $[k]=(\delta_{11},\ldots,\delta_{1k})=(1,0,\ldots,0)$ and by definition of the $C$'s,
\[
   X(M)X(N)=\sum_PC_{MN}^PX(P).
\]
But we had seen that the set of the $X(A)$ with $A=(0,\ldots,0,a_{r+1},\ldots,a_n)$ form a subalgebra of $U(\lG)$. Then, only terms with $P=(0,\ldots,0,p_{r+1},\ldots,p_n)$ are present in the sum; in particular, $C_{MN}^{[k]}=0$ for $k=1,\ldots,r$. Thus $VV\cap N_e\subset V$.

The next step is to consider $\mV$, the set of all the subset of $H$ whose contains a neighbourhood of $e$ in $V$. We can check that this fulfils the six axioms of a topological group\index{topological!group}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The intersection of two elements of $\mV$ is in $\mV$;
\item the intersection of all the elements of $\mV$ is $\{e\}$;
\item any subset of $H$ which contains a set of $\mV$ is in $\mV$;
\item If $\mU\in\mV$, there exists a $\mU_1\in\mV$ such that $\mU_1\mU_1\subset\mU$ because $VV\cap N_e\subset V$;
\item if $\mU\in\mV$, then $\mU^{-1}\in\mV$ because the inverse map is differentiable and transforms a neighbourhood of $e$ into a neighbourhood of $e$;
\item if $\mU\in\mV$ and $h\in H$, then $h\mU h^{-1}\in\mV$.
\end{enumerate}

To see this last item, we denote by $\log$ the inverse map of $\dpt{\exp}{B_{\delta}}{N_e}$. By definition of $V$, it sends $V$ on $\lH\cap B_{\delta}$. If $X\in\lG$, there exists one and only one $X'\in\lG$ such that $he^{tX}h^{-1}=e^{tX'}$ for any $t\in\eR$. Indeed we know that $he^{X}h^{-1}=e^{\Ad_hX}$, then $X'$ must satisfy $e^{tX'}=e^{\Ad_htX}$. If it is true for any $t$, then, by derivation, $X'=\Ad_hX$.

The map $X\to X'$ is an automorphism of $\lG$ which sent $\lH$ on itself. So one can find a $\delta_1$ with $0<\delta_1<\delta$ such that
\[
   h\exp({B_{\delta_1}\cap\lH})h^{-1}\subset V.
\]
Indeed, $he^{\lH} h^{-1}\subset\lH$, so that taking $\delta_1<\delta$, we get the strict inclusion. We can choose $\delta_1$ even smaller to satisfy $he^{B_{\delta_1}}h^{-1}\subset N_e$. Since the map $X\to\log(he^{X}h^{-1})$ from $B_{\delta_1\cap\lH}$ to $B_{\delta}\cap\lH$ is regular, the image of $B_{\delta_1}\cap\lH$ is a neighbourhood of $0$ in $\lH$. Thus $he^{B_{\delta_1}\cap\lH}h^{-1}$ is a neighbourhood of $e$ in $V$. Finally, $h\mU h^{-1}\in\mV$ and the last axiom of a topological group is checked.

This is important because there exists a topology on $H$ such that $H$ becomes a topological group and $\mV$ is a family of neighbourhood of $e$ in $H$. In particular, $V$ is a neighbourhood of $e$ in $H$.

For any $z\in G$, we define the map $\dpt{\phi_z}{zN_e}{B_{\delta}}$ by
\begin{equation}
  \phi_z(ze^{x_1X_1+\cdots+x_nX_n})=(x_1,\ldots,x_n),
\end{equation}
and we denote by $\varphi_z$ the restriction of $\phi_z$ to $zV$. If $z\in H$, then $\varphi_z$ sends the neighbourhood $zV$ of $z$ in $H$ to the open set $B_{\delta}\cap\lH$ in $\eR^{n-r}$. Indeed, an element of $zV$ is a $ze^Z$ with $Z\in\lH\cap B_{\delta}$ which is sent by $\varphi_z$ to an element of $\lH\cap B_{\delta}$. (we just have to identify $x_1X_1+\cdots+x_nX_n$ with $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$).

Moreover, if $z_1,z_2\in H$, the map $\varphi_{z_1}\circ\varphi_{z_2}^{-1}$ is the restriction to an open subset of $\lH$ of $\phi_{z_1}\circ\phi_{z_2}$. Then $\varphi_{z_1}\circ\varphi_{z_2}^{-1}$ is differentiable. Conclusion: $(H,\varphi_z: z\in H)$ is a differentiable manifold.

Recall that the definition of $\lH$ was to be a subalgebra of $\lG$; therefore $V=e^{\lH\cap B_{\delta}}$ is a submanifold of $G$. But the left translations are diffeomorphism of $H$ and $H$ is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $e^{\lH}$. Thus $H$ is a manifold on which the multiplication is diffeomorphic and consequently, $H$ is a Lie subgroup of $G$.

Rest to prove that the Lie algebra of $H$ is $\lH$ and the unicity part of the theorem.

We know that $\dim H=\dim\lH$ and moreover for $i>r$, the map $t\to\exp tX_i$ is a curve in $H$. Now, the fact that $\lH$ is the set of $X\in\lG$ such that $t\to\exp tX$ is a path in $H$ show that $X_i\in\lH$. Then the Lie algebra of $H$ is $\lH$ and $H$ is a connected group because it is generated by $\exp\lH$ which is a connected neighbourhood of $e$ in $H$.

We turn our attention to the unicity part. Let $H_1$ be a connected Lie subgroup of $G$ such that $T_eH_1=\lH$. Since $\exp_{\lH}X=\exp_{\lH_1}X$, $H=H_1$ as set. But $\exp$ is a differentiable diffeomorphism from a neighbourhood of $0$ in $\lH$ to a neighbourhood of $e$ in $H$ and $H_1$, so as Lie groups, $H$ and $H_1$ are the same.
\end{proof}

\section{Matrix Lie group and its algebra}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\label{SECooTSAJooNtjgMD}

In this section we deal with Lie groups made from matrices, that is subgroups of \( \GL(n, \eC)\) (typically \( \SO(n)\) or \( \SU(n)\)) and their Lie algebra. We will denote the identity either by \( e\) or by \( \mtu\).

\begin{normaltext}      \label{NORMooHZGKooJEiamo}
    It is time to reread the remark \ref{REMooJQFHooQuoZxt}. In this section, when \( \gamma\) is a path in the matrix group \( G\), we denote by \( \gamma'(0)\) the ``usual'' derivative of \( \gamma\): that is the component-wise derivative; not the differential operator.

    We denote by \( D_{\gamma}\) the differential operator
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            D_{\gamma}\colon  C^{\infty}(G)&\to \eR \\
            f&\mapsto \Dsdd{ f\big( \gamma(t) \big) }{t}{0}. 
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

    We aim to study the link between \( D_{\gamma}\) and \( \gamma'(0)\).

    From the Lie group of matrix \( G\) we can build (at least) two Lie algebras\footnote{Definition \ref{DEFooVBPKooGxlDBn}.}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The usual Lie algebra of the group: \( T_eG\) with the definition \ref{DEFooKDCPooZOJsMD}. As set, this is
            \begin{equation}
                T_eG=\{ D_{\gamma}\st \gamma(0)=e \}
            \end{equation}
            with the implicit that \( \gamma\) is a smooth path in \( G\).
        \item 
            The set of ``usual'' derivatives of the paths in \( G\):
            \begin{equation}
                G'=\{ \gamma'(0)\tq \gamma(0)=e \}.
            \end{equation}
            This is a set of matrices on which we can use the bracket \( [X,Y]=XY-YX\) (matrix product). We will see 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item 
                    \( G'\) is a Lie algebra in proposition \ref{PROPooUKITooLnEKZW},
                \item
                    \( G'\) and \( T_eG\) are isomorphic as Lie algebras in theorem \ref{THOooWQGMooHyjRtx} for the case \( G=\GL(n,\eC)\)
                \item
                    \( H'\) and \( T_eH\) are isomorphic as Lie algebras in proposition \ref{PROPooSQHLooGQAykc} for the Lie subgroups of \( \GL(n,\eC)\).
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{normaltext}

\begin{lemma}[\cite{MonCerveau}]
    Let \( G\) be a matrix Lie group, et \( g\in G\) and \( X\in G'\). Then \( gXg^{-1}\in G'\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let \( x\colon \eR\to G\) be a smooth path such that \( X=x'(0)\). Then we the derivative of the path given by the matrix product
    \begin{equation}
        t\mapsto gx(t)g^{-1}
    \end{equation}
    is \( gXg^{-1}\).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[\cite{MonCerveau}]        \label{LEMooHQUYooSoiKbI}
    Let \( G\) be a matrix Lie group. Then \( G'\) is a vector space on \( \eR\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let \( X,Y\in G'\) be the derivatives of the paths \( x\) and \( y\). If we set \( \varphi_1(t)=x(t)y(t)\) we have
    \begin{equation}
        \varphi_1'(0)=x'(0)y(0)+x(0)y'(0).
    \end{equation}
    Since \( x(0)=y(0)=e\) we have \( \varphi'(0)=X+Y\), so that \( X+Y\in G'\).

    For the product by a scalar, let the path \( \varphi_2(t)=x(\lambda t)\). The component-wise derivative
    \begin{equation}
        \varphi_2'(0)=\lambda x'(0)=\lambda X,
    \end{equation}
    so that \( \lambda X\in G'\).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}     \label{PROPooUKITooLnEKZW}
    Let \( G\) be a matrix Lie group. The vector space \( G'\) is a Lie algebra for the matrix commutator.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    We already know that \( G'\) is a real vector space by lemma \ref{LEMooHQUYooSoiKbI}. The fact that \( (X,Y)\mapsto XY-YX\) satisfies the axioms of a Lie algebra is easy to check. The only point is to show that if \( X,Y\in G'\), then \( [X,Y]=XY-YX\in G'\).

    Let
    \begin{equation}        \label{EQooJDTLooGWsDiq}
        \varphi(t)=x(t)Yx(-t).
    \end{equation}
    This is for sure a path in the full matrix vector space, and this is derivable because \( x\) is derivable while the matrix product is linear. So the derivative \( \varphi'(0)\) is still a matrix. The question is: why \( \varphi'(0)\in G'\) ?

    By lemma \ref{LEMooHQUYooSoiKbI}, for each \( t\) we have
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{ \varphi(t)-\varphi(0) }{ t }\in G'.
    \end{equation}
    Now, \( G'\) is a vector subspace of \( \eM(n,\eC)\) which is finite dimensional; is is thus closed and the limit belongs to \( G'\).

    Is is now a simple computation to show that \( \varphi'(0)=[X,Y]\).
\end{proof}

\begin{normaltext}
The following theorem is a Giulietta's masterpiece in the following sense:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is fundamental because the Lie algebra isomorphism between \( T_eGL(n,\eR)\) and the matrices is used everywhere one says «The Lie algebra of $\SO(3)$ is the set of skew-symmetric traceless matrices».
    \item
        Either I'm idiot, either I never seen that theorem even stated (let alone being proved)\footnote{There is in fact a third possibility:  this theorem is a classic one but cannot be found \emph{on internet}.}.
    \item
        I think that the fundamental misunderstanding\footnote{Once again, either I'm idiot either everybody is wrong but me\ldots well \ldots} is that in the context of Lie groups, people \emph{define} \( [X,Y]\) as being \( \ad(X)Y\) while \( \ad\) is defined as the ``second differential'' of \( \AD(g)h=ghg^{-1}\). In that case, obviously we get \( [X,Y]=XY-YX\) with the matrix product. This way fails to make the link with the commutator of vector fields as defined by \ref{DEFooHOTOooRaPwyo}.
    \item
        So you must read this proof with much care and write me if you see any mistake or unclear point.
\end{itemize}
\end{normaltext}
So here it is with the notations explained in \ref{NORMooHZGKooJEiamo}.
    

\begin{theorem}     \label{THOooWQGMooHyjRtx}
    Let \( G=\GL(n,\eC)\) be the group of invertible matrices. The map
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            \phi\colon G'&\to T_eG \\
            \gamma'(0)&\mapsto D_{\gamma} 
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    is 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
            well defined,
        \item
            bijective,
        \item
            linear,
        \item
            a Lie algebra isomorphism.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Several points to be proved.
    \begin{subproof}
        \item[\( \phi\) is well defined]
            Let \( \alpha\) and \( \beta\) be paths in \( G\) such that \( \alpha'(0)=\beta'(0)\) and let \( f\colon G\to \eR\) be a smooth function. We have to prove that \( D_{\alpha}(f)=D_{\beta}(f)\).

            We consider a chart \( \varphi\colon \mU\to \mO\) where \( \mU\) is a neighbourhood of \( 0\) in \( \eR^m\) and \( \mO\) is a neighbourhood of \( e\) in \( \GL(n,\eC)\). We suppose that \( \varphi(0)=e\). We set \( \tilde f=f\circ \varphi\), \( \tilde \alpha=\varphi^{-1}\circ \alpha\) and \( \tilde \beta=\varphi^{-1}\circ\beta\). We have
            \begin{subequations}
                \begin{align}
                    D_{\alpha}(f)&=\Dsdd{ f\big( \alpha(t) \big) }{t}{0}\\
                    &=\Dsdd{ \tilde f\big( \tilde \alpha(t) \big) }{t}{0}\\
                    &=\sum_{i=1}^m\frac{ \partial \tilde f }{ \partial x_i }\big( \tilde \alpha(0) \big)\tilde \alpha_i(0).
                \end{align}
            \end{subequations}
            Since \( \tilde \alpha(0)=\tilde \beta(0)\) we still have to prove that \( \tilde \alpha_i'(0)=\tilde \beta_i'(0)\). As you remember, \( \tilde \alpha\) is a map from \( \eR\) to \( \eR^m\), so that the following derivative is quite usual:
            \begin{subequations}
                \begin{align}
                    \tilde \alpha'(0)&=\Dsdd{ (\varphi^{-1}\circ \alpha)(t) }{t}{0}\\
                    &=d\varphi^{-1}_{\alpha(0)}\big( \alpha'(0) \big)\\
                    &=d\varphi^{-1}_{\beta(0)}\big( \beta'(0) \big).
                \end{align}
            \end{subequations}
            Thus the map \( \phi\) is well defined.
        \item[\( \phi\) is linear]
            This is from the linearity of the derivation.
        \item[\( \phi\) is injective]
            If \( \phi(\alpha')=\phi(\beta')\), then \( D_{\alpha}(f)=D_{\beta}(f)\) for every function \( f\). In that case,
            \begin{equation}
                \sum_{i=1}^m\frac{ \partial \tilde f }{ \partial x_i }(e)\tilde \alpha_i'(0)=\sum_{i=1}^m\frac{ \partial \tilde f }{ \partial x_i }(e)\tilde \beta_i'(0).
            \end{equation}
            That equation must be satisfied for every function. Taking the projection on the components, we get \( \tilde \alpha_i'(0)=\tilde b_i'(0)\), which means \( \alpha'(0)=\beta'(0)\) because \( \varphi^{-1}\) is bijective.
        \item[\( \phi\) is surjective]
            Every element of \( T_eG\) is of the form \( D_{\alpha}\) for some path \( \alpha\), so \( \phi\) is surjective.
        \item[\( \phi\) is a Lie algebra isomorphism]
            Let \( X,Y\in G'\) being the derivative of the paths \( \alpha\) and \( \beta\). We have to prove that
            \begin{equation}
                [\phi(X),\phi(Y)]=\phi[X,Y].
            \end{equation}
            If \( t\) is small enough, the paths
            \begin{subequations}
                \begin{align}
                    \alpha(t)=\mtu+tX\\
                    \beta(t)=\mtu+tY\\
                \end{align}
            \end{subequations}
            are good ones because \( \det(\mtu)\neq 0\), so that the determinant of \( \mtu+tX\) remains different from zero when \( t\) is small, whatever \( X\) is. So \( \alpha\) and \( \beta\) are paths in \( \GL(n,\eC)\). Using the general definition in differential geometry,
            \begin{subequations}        \label{SUBEQSooCYRDooFOdLrn}
                \begin{align}
                    [\phi(X),\phi(Y)]f&=[\phi(X)^L,\phi(Y)^L]_ef\\
                    &=\phi(X)^L_e\big( \phi(Y)^L(f) \big)-\phi(Y)^L_e\big( \phi(X)^L(f) \big) \label{SUBEQooOPUAooZYsZlX}.
                \end{align}
            \end{subequations}
            We focus on the first term:
            \begin{subequations}        \label{SUBEQooTUNFooFkDmuP}
                \begin{align}
                    \phi(X)^L\big( \phi(Y)^L(f) \big)&=\Dsdd{ \phi(Y)^L_{\phi(X)^L_e(t)}(f) }{t}{0}\\
                    &=\DDsdd{ f\big( (\mtu+tX)(\mtu+sY) \big) }{t}{0}{s}{0}\\
                    &=\DDsdd{ f(\mtu+tX+sY+tsXY) }{t}{0}{s}{0}\\
                    &=\Dsdd{ df_{\mtu+tX}\big( (\mtu+tX)Y \big) }{t}{0} \label{SUBEQooLHPBooTnXiZd}\\
                    &=\Dsdd{ df_{\mtu+tX}(Y) }{t}{0}+\Dsdd{ df_{\mtu+tX}(tXY) }{t}{0}   \label{SUBEQooMXJJooBFTLsM}
                \end{align}
            \end{subequations}
            where we have used the linearity of \( df_{\mtu+tX}\) and where \( XY\) stands for the matrix product. In the expression \eqref{SUBEQooLHPBooTnXiZd}, the symbol \( df\) stands for the differential of \( f\) as function from \( \eM(n,\eC)\) (as vector space), not for the differential of \( f\) on \( G\) as manifold. This is why we are allowed to put an expression as the matrix \( Y\) as argument of \( df_{\mtu+tX}\) while \( Y\) is not an element of \( T_{\mtu+tX}G\).

            The expression \eqref{SUBEQooMXJJooBFTLsM} is still made of two terms. The second one is
            \begin{equation}
                \Dsdd{ df_{\mtu+tX}(tXY) }{t}{0}=\Dsdd{ tdf_{\mtu+tX}(XY) }{t}{0}=df_{\mtu}(XY)
            \end{equation}
            where we used the Leibnitz rule\footnote{In general, notice that \( \Dsdd{ tf(t) }{t}{0}=f(0)\)}.

            The first term in \eqref{SUBEQooMXJJooBFTLsM} is computed as
            \begin{equation}
                    \Dsdd{ df_{\mtu+tX}(Y) }{t}{0}=\DDsdd{ f(\mtu+tX+sY) }{t}{0}{s}{0}.
            \end{equation}
            We set 
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{aligned}
                    \gamma\colon \eR^2&\to G \\
                    (t,s)&\mapsto \mtu+tX+sY, 
                \end{aligned}
            \end{equation}
            so that
            \begin{subequations}
                \begin{align}
                    \Dsdd{ df_{\mtu+tX}(Y) }{t}{0}&=\DDsdd{ f(\mtu+tX+sY) }{t}{0}{s}{0}\\
                    &=\DDsdd{ (\tilde f\circ\varphi^{-1}\circ\gamma)(t,s) }{t}{0}{s}{0}\\
                    &=\DDsdd{ g(t,s) }{t}{0}{s}{0}
                \end{align}
            \end{subequations}
            where the function \( g=\tilde f\circ\varphi^{-1}\circ \gamma\) is a smooth function from \( \eR^2\) to \( \eR\).        

            The expression \eqref{SUBEQooTUNFooFkDmuP} is now
            \begin{equation}
                \phi(X)^L\big( \phi(Y)^L(f) \big)=\DDsdd{ g(t,s) }{t}{0}{s}{0}+df_{\mtu}(XY).
            \end{equation}
            The commutator we have to compute, with the same computations is
            \begin{equation}
                [\phi(X),\phi(Y)]f=\DDsdd{ g(t,s) }{t}{0}{s}{0}+df_{\mtu}(XY)-\DDsdd{ g(s,t) }{t}{0}{s}{0}-df_{\mtu}(YX).
            \end{equation}
            The function \( g\) being \(  C^{\infty}\), the derivative commute and the corresponding termes annihilate each other and we are left with
            \begin{equation}
                [\phi(X),\phi(Y)]f=df_{\mtu}(XY)-df_{\mtu}(YX)=df_{\mtu}(XY-YX)
            \end{equation}
            where we used the linearity of the differential.

            In the other sense,
            \begin{equation}
                \phi[X,Y]f=\Dsdd{ f(\mtu+tXY-tYX) }{t}{0}=df_{\mtu}\big( [X,Y] \big)
            \end{equation}
            where, once again, \( df\) stands for the ``usual'' differential.
    \end{subproof}
\end{proof}

Ok. This is proved for \( G=\GL(n,\eC)\), the full matrix group. What about subgroups ? Here is the result.

\begin{proposition}[\cite{MonCerveau}]      \label{PROPooSQHLooGQAykc}
    Let \( H\) be a Lie subgroup\footnote{Thanks to the Cartan theorem \ref{THOooDEJHooVKJYBL}, there are plenty of them.} of \( \GL(n,\eC)\). With the same notations as above, the map
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            \phi\colon H'&\to T_eH \\
            \gamma'(0)&\mapsto D_{\gamma} 
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    is a Lie algebra isomorphism.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    We have to prove that
    \begin{equation}        \label{EQooRLBBooYgHhtH}
        \phi[X,Y]f=[\phi(X),\phi(Y)]f
    \end{equation}
    for every \( X,Y\in H'\) and \( f\in  C^{\infty}(H)\). For that, we will see the left and right hand sides of \eqref{EQooRLBBooYgHhtH} in \( G=\GL(n,\eC)\), and use the already proved result, theorem \ref{THOooWQGMooHyjRtx}.

    If \( X,Y\in H'\) we know from proposition \ref{PROPooUKITooLnEKZW} that \( [X,Y]\in H'\). Thus there exists a path \( \gamma\colon \eR\to H\) such that \( [X,Y]=\gamma'(0)\). We consider the extension\footnote{The proposition \ref{PROPooOTZQooIfboXV} can be used since \( H\) is a submanifold of \( G\) by \ref{PROPooFXZJooCOFXZX}.} \( \tilde f\colon W\to \eR\) of \( f\) such that \( \tilde f=f\) on \( H\) and \( W\) is an open set around \( e\) in \( \GL(n,\eC)\). For the sake of making things complicated we also define \( \tilde \gamma=\iota\circ \gamma\) where \( \iota\colon H\to \GL(n,\eC)\) is the inclusion. With all that we have
    \begin{equation}
        \phi[X,Y]f=\Dsdd{ f\big( \gamma(t) \big) }{t}{0}=\Dsdd{ \tilde f\big( \tilde \gamma(t) \big) }{t}{0}=\clubsuit.
    \end{equation}
    At this point, notice that \( [X,Y]\in \GL(n,\eC)'\) and \( [X,Y]=\tilde \gamma'(0)\), so that if we consider \( \tilde \phi\colon \GL(n,\eC)\to T_e\GL(n,\eC)\) we also have
    \begin{equation}
        \clubsuit=\Dsdd{ \tilde f\big( \tilde \gamma(t) \big) }{t}{0}=\tilde \phi[X,Y]\tilde f=\big[ \tilde \phi(X),\tilde \phi(Y) \big]\tilde f
    \end{equation}
    where we used the result \ref{THOooWQGMooHyjRtx} on \( \GL(n,\eC)\).

    We still have to prove that \( \tilde \phi(X)\tilde \phi(Y)\tilde f=\phi(X)\phi(Y)f\). Using, among others the formula \ref{SUBEQSooHKWMooQbeStl} adapted to \( \tilde \phi(X)\) instead of \( X\):
    \begin{subequations}
        \begin{align}
            \tilde \phi(X)\tilde \phi(Y)\tilde f&=\Dsdd{ \big( \tilde \phi(Y)^L\tilde f \big)\big( \alpha(t) \big) }{t}{0}\\
            &=\Dsdd{ \tilde \phi(Y)^L_{\alpha(t)}\tilde f }{t}{0}\\
            &=\DDsdd{ \tilde f\big( \alpha(t)\beta(u) \big) }{t}{0}{s}{0}.
        \end{align}
    \end{subequations}
    At this point, notice that \( \alpha(t)\) and \( \beta(u)\) are elements in \( H\) which is a group, so \( \tilde f\big( \alpha(t)\beta(u) \big)=f\big( \alpha(t)\beta(u) \big)\). Thus
    \begin{subequations}
        \begin{align}
            \tilde \phi(X)\tilde \phi(Y)\tilde f&=\DDsdd{ \tilde f\big( \alpha(t)\beta(u) \big) }{t}{0}{s}{0}\\
            &=\DDsdd{ f\big( \alpha(t)\beta(u) \big) }{t}{0}{s}{0}\\
            &=\phi(X)\phi(y)f.
        \end{align}
    \end{subequations}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[\cite{MonCerveau}]
    Let \( G\) be a Lie group of matrices and \( X\in T_eG\) such that 
    \begin{equation}
        df_e(X)=0
    \end{equation}
    for every smooth function \( f\colon G\to \eR\). Then \( X=0\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    We consider the functions \( \pr_{ij}\colon G\to \eR\) defined by \( \pr_{ij}(A)=A_{ij}\). If \( g\colon \eR\to G\) is a path, for every \( t\) we have \( \pr_{ij}g(t)=g(t)_{ij}\) and then
    \begin{equation}
        \Dsdd{ \pr_{ij}g(t) }{t}{0}=g'(0)_{ij}.
    \end{equation}
    Then we build
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            f\colon G&\to \eR \\
            A&\mapsto \pr_{11}(A)\pr_{ij}(A). 
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    If \( g\colon \eR\to G\) is a path such that \( g(0)=e\) and \( g'(0)=X\), then we have
    \begin{subequations}
        \begin{align}
            \Dsdd{ f\big( g(t) \big) }{t}{0}&=\Dsdd{ \pr_{11}\big( g(t) \big)\pr_{ij}\big( g(t) \big) }{t}{0}\\
            &=\pr_{11}g(0)\Dsdd{ \pr_{ij}g(t) }{t}{0}+\Dsdd{ \pr_{11}g(t) }{t}{0}\pr_{ij}g(0)\\
            &=X_{ij}+\delta_{ij}X_{11}\\
            &=X_{ij}+\delta_{ij}X_{11}.
        \end{align}
    \end{subequations}
    We know that this is zero for every choice of \( ij\):
    \begin{equation}
        X_{ij}+\delta_{ij}X_{11}=0
    \end{equation}
    In particular with \( i=j=1\) we have \( 2X_{11}=0\), so that \( X_{11}=0\). Then we are left with \( X_{ij}=0\) for every \( ij\).
\end{proof}
