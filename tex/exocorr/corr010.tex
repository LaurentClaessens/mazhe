By definition of $c$ as an integral curve of $X$, we have
\[ 
  \dot c(t)=X_{c(t)}
\]
for all $t$.
The requirement for $c\circ\alpha$ to be an integral curve of $Y$ reads
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(c\circ\alpha)'(t)&=c'\big( \alpha(t) \big)\alpha'(t)\\
		&\stackrel{!}{=}Y_{(c\circ\alpha)(t)}\\
		&=f\big( (c\circ\alpha)(t) \big)X_{(c\circ\alpha)(t)}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Since we supposed that $X$ is non vanishing, $c'(t)\neq 0$ everywhere. So we find the following differential equation for $\alpha$:
\begin{equation}
\alpha'(t)=(f\circ c)(\alpha(t)).
\end{equation}
The existence of a solution for this equation is given by the following powerful theorem \ref{tho_exuniintcur}.

Remark that this theorem only deals with continuity (not smoothness). It should be an exercise to find an even more powerful theorem which ensures the smoothness of $\alpha$.
