For each $t_0$, it is clear that $\dot\gamma(t_0)\in T_{t_0}C$. The problem is to prove that the function $\dpt{ f }{ C }{ \eR^2\times\eR^2 }$, $f(x)=(x,X_x)$ is smooth. Let $x$ be a point of $C$ and $\mU$ an open neighbourhood of $x$. We have to find a smooth extension $\dpt{ \tilde f }{ \mU }{ \eR^2\times\eR^2 }$ of $f$. In particular, we have to find an extension $\hat X$ of $X$ in a neighbourhood $\hat C$ of $C$ in $\eR^2$.

\paragraph{First method}
%-----------------------

Since $\gamma$ is a chart, it can be extended to a smooth bijection $\dpt{ \tilde\gamma }{ \,]-1,1[\times]-1,1[\, }{ \mU }$ such that $\tilde\gamma(0,t)=\gamma(t)$. For each $y=\tilde\gamma(u_0,t_0)\in \mU$, we define 
\[ 
  \tilde X_y=\Dsdd{ \tilde\gamma(u,t) }{t}{t_0}.
\]
Now we define $\tilde f(y)=(y,\tilde X_y)$. The vector field $\tilde X$ being a directional derivative of a smooth function, it is itself a smooth function.

Here is a partial proof of the existence of the extension $\hat\gamma$. 

\begin{lemma}
Let $\varphi$ be a chart of an embedded curve $C$ in $\eR^2$; is is seen as a map $\dpt{ \varphi }{ \mU }{ \hat C }$ where $\hat C$ is an open neighbourhood of $C$ in $\eR^2$.

Then there exists an open set $W\subset \eR^2$ and a smooth map $\dpt{ \varphi_2 }{W}{ \hat C }$ such that $\dpt{ \tilde\varphi=\varphi_2^{-1}\circ\varphi }{ \mU }{ W }$ has the form
\[ 
  \tilde\varphi(x)=(x,0).
\]

\end{lemma}
We will not prove it here.

Now we can extend this $\tilde\varphi$ to the map $\dpt{ \hat{\tilde\varphi} }{ \mU\times I }{ W }$ by $\hat{\tilde\varphi}(x,y)=(x,y)$ for a suitable neighbourhood $I$ of $0$ in $\eR$. Then we look at
\[ 
  \dpt{ \hat\varphi=\varphi_2\circ\hat{\tilde\varphi} }{ \mU\times I }{ \hat C }
\]
which is smooth.

How to choice $I$ ?  For each $x\in\mU$, the point $(x,0)$ belongs to the open set $W\subset \eR^2$. Therefore there exists a non empty neighbourhood $I_x$ of $0$ such that $(x,I_x)\subset W$. Taking if necessary a smallest chart $\mU'$ instead of $\mU$, one can take the non empty set
$I=\bigcap_{x\in\mU}I_x$.
