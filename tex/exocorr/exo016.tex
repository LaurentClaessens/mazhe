\begin{exercice}\label{exo016}

Since basis vectors given in equation \eqref{eq_basvecto} are just derivatives with respect to coordinates, it is obvious that they commute: $[e_i,e_j]=0$. The fact that basis vectors commute seems to prove that any vector field should commute. Find the mistake. Can you find two vector fields on the sphere which doesn't commute ?
