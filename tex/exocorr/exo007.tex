\begin{exercice}\label{exo007}

 Prove that the data of a tangent vector field $X$ on a curve $C$ is equivalent to the data
of a smooth map $\dpt{ \Xi }{ C }{ \eR^2 }$ with $\Xi(x)\in T_xC$, the identification being given by $\Xi(x)=X_x$.  In other words, locally, a tangent vector field on
a curve embbeded in $\eR^2$ is the restriction to $C$ of a vector field $\hat{\Xi}$ on some open neighbourhood  $U$
of $C$ in $\eR^2$. Draw a picture illustrating this fact.
