Let us begin by \emph{almost} true proof. Why ``almost'' ? Because we will not care about \emph{locality} problems. We will speak about $C$, $\eR^2$,\ldots while we should speak about ``a neigborhood of $x_0\in C$''\ldots You should do it as an exercise.

Let $\dpt{ \varphi }{ \mU }{ C }$ be a paramertization of $C$ with tangent vector field $V$. We want to find a new parametrization $\dpt{ \phi }{ \mU' }{ C }$ with tangent vector field $X_x=f(x)V_x$ where the smooth function $f$ is given. In other words, we want a $\dpt{ a }{ \mU' }{ \mU }$ and $\phi=\varphi\circ a$ with
\[ 
  \phi'(t)=(\varphi\circ a)'(t)=\varphi'(a(t))a'(t).
\]
The function $a$ is the solution of the differential equation
\[ 
  a'(t)=f\big( a(t) \big).
\]

So another way to state this result is to say that there always exists a reparametrization of a curve for which the tangent vector field is given.
