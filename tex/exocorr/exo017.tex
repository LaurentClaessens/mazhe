\begin{exercice}\label{exo017}
Consider the algebra $ C^{\infty}(S^{2})$ of smooth functions on the sphere $S^{2}$ and the Lie algebra $\cvec(S^{2})$ of smooth vector fields. Consider the vector field
\[ 
  Y_{i}=\sum_{j,k=1}^{3}\epsilon_{ijk}x_{j}\frac{ \partial }{ \partial x_{k} }
\]
with $\sum_{j}(x_{j})^{2}=1$ .
Check that $Y_{i}$ is actually a tangent vector and prove that these vector fields generate the whole algebra.  Then, prove that this set is not free because
\[ 
  \sum_{j}x_{j}Y_{j}=0.
\]
This proves that the tangent space of $S^{2}$ is non trivial.
