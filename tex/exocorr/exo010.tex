\begin{exercice}\label{exo010}

Prove the following.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem_XYparall}

Let $X$ be a smooth non vanishing vector field on an open set $\mU$ in $\eR^2$, $\dpt{ f }{ \mU }{ \eR }$ a smooth non vanishing function and $Y$ the smooth vector field on $\mU$ defined by $Y_x=f(x)X_x$. If $\dpt{ c }{ I }{ \eR^2 }$ is an integral curve of $X$, then there exists a smooth map $\dpt{ \alpha }{ I }{ \eR }$ such that $c\circ\alpha$ is an integral curve of $Y$.

In other words, if one changes the norm of a vector field, then one just has to change the parametrization of integral curves.
