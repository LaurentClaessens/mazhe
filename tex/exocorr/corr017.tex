Let us pick a point $x=(x_1,x_2,x3)\in S^2$ and check that the vector $Y_i(x)$ is tangent to $S^2$ at the point $x$. For that, we just have to prove that the product of $Y_i(x)$ and $x$ is zero (when you are tangent to a sphere, you are perpendicular to the radius):
\[ 
  Y_i(x)\cdot\begin{pmatrix}
x_1\\x_2\\x_3
\end{pmatrix}
=
\sum_{j,k=1}^{3}\epsilon_{ijk}x_jx_k=0
\]
because contraction of symmetric indices ($jk$ in $x_jx_k$) and skew-symmetric indices ($jk$ in $\epsilon_{ijk}$) is zero.
