\begin{exercice}\label{exo008}

In the setting of exercise \ref{exo007}, prove that the curve $C$ is an \defe{integral curve}{}
of $\hat{\Xi}$ i.e. for all initial data $x_0\in C$ the solution $x=x(t),\;t\in]-\epsilon,\epsilon[$ to the Cauchy problem
\[ 
 \dot{x}=\hat{\Xi}\;;\quad x(0)=x_0 
\]
is a local chart on $C$ around $x_0$. We suppose that $X$ is non vanishing.

\paragraph{Hints} Draw a circle and any smooth tangent vector field. Extend it in any smooth manner. Then pick a point on the circle. Is it possible to find an integral curve of your vector field which is not the circle ? Try and convince yourself that the integral curves of a vector field $X$ are defined by the field of \emph{directions} and are independent of the \emph{norm} of $X_x$.
