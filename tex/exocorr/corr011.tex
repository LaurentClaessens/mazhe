The fact for $\mI$ to be bilinear, symmetric, positive definite and nondegenerate comes from the corresponding properties of the inner product on $\eR^3$. The eventual problem is smoothness. As usual, we have to find extensions. Let $X$, $Y\in\cvec(\Sigma)$; the problem is to find a (local) smooth extension of the function $\dpt{ \mI(X,Y) }{ \Sigma }{ \eR }$, $x\mapsto \mI_x(X_x,Y_x)=X_x\cdot Y_x$. If $\hat X$ and $\hat Y$ are extensions of $X$ and $Y$, what do you think about 
\[ 
 \hat\mI(X,Y)(y)=\hat X_y\cdot \hat Y_y\quad ?
\]
