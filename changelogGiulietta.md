# Giulietta's changelog

## Manifolds (January 2021)

Be more precise and systematic about
- definition of charts
- tangent vectors
- integration

## Lorentz (December 2019-January 2020)

- Adjoint
- Boost
- Standard decomposition

## sl(2,C)  (Augustus 2019)

- Finite dimensional irreducible representations of the Lie algebra sl(2,C)

## Suppress the dependency 'exocorr' (2019 June)

- Add `\input{exocorr}` in `e_mazhe.tex`. The file `exocorr.tex` is now essentially a copy of `exocorr.sty`[1].
- Not that dependency anymore.
- Update the tutorials `COMPILATION_frido.md` and `COMPILATION_giulietta.md`

## Exponential map and Taylor expansion for Lie groups (2019 May - 2019 June)

- Definition of the exponential from the left-invariant vector fields
- A Lie group must be analytical
- Taylor formula
- Proof of exp(A+B+t^2[A,B]/2)=exp(tA)exp(tB)+o(t^2)

## SU(2) (2018 December - ...)

- The Pauli matrices
- Isomorphism SO(3)=SU(2)/Z2.
- Continuous paths lifted from SO(3) to SU(2)
- Representations of U(1)

## Lie subgroup (2019 January)

- Prove the rank theorem for maps between manifolds.
- Prove that a Lie subgroup is a submanifold.
- Separate Lie group/Lie algebra/links in three chapters.

## Giulietta (2019 January 1)

Change the name 'mazhe'/'everything' -> 'giulietta'.

## Lie algebra of a matrix Lie group (2018 December)

Settle the identification between the tangent vectors on GL(n) as differential operators
and the derivative of a path in GL(n) a matrix.

## Unitary operators (2018 December)

- definition of a unitary operator on a separable Hilbert space
- center of SU(n)
