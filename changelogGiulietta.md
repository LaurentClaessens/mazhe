# Giulietta's changelog

## Differential geometry (April-May 2022)

- Measure and positive linear form (Kakutani-Riesz representation theorem).
- Frobenius theorem

## Differential geometry (March 2022)

- Kakutani theorem
- Immersions are local embeddings.

## SU(2) (February 2022)

- Put some order in the statements about the Lie group structure of SU(2).
- Add some statement about analyticity
- Lie group smooth morphisms have constant rank.

## Manifolds (January 2021)

Be more precise and systematic about
- definition of charts
- tangent vectors
- integration

## Lorentz (December 2019-January 2020)

- Adjoint
- Boost
- Standard decomposition

## sl(2,C)  (Augustus 2019)

- Finite dimensional irreducible representations of the Lie algebra sl(2,C)

## Suppress the dependency 'exocorr' (2019 June)

- Add `\input{exocorr}` in `e_mazhe.tex`. The file `exocorr.tex` is now essentially a copy of `exocorr.sty`[1].
- Not that dependency anymore.
- Update the tutorials `COMPILATION_frido.md` and `COMPILATION_giulietta.md`

## Giulietta (2019 January 1)

Change the name 'mazhe'/'everything' -> 'giulietta'.

## Lie algebra of a matrix Lie group (2018 December)

Settle the identification between the tangent vectors on GL(n) as differential operators
